Safety note
WARNING: The connectors may not be plugged in or disconnected
under load. Ignoring the warning or improper use may damage persons
and/or property.
• WARNING: Commission properly functioning products only. The
products must be regularly inspected for damage. Decommission
defective products immediately. Replace damaged products. Repairs
are not possible.
• WARNING: Only electrically qualified personnel may install and
operate the product. They must observe the following safety notes.
The qualified personnel must be familiar with the basics of electrical
engineering. They must be able to recognize and prevent danger. The
relevant symbol on the packaging indicates that only personnel familiar
with electrical engineering are allowed to install and operate the product.
• The products are suitable for applications in plant, controller, and
electrical device engineering.
• When operating the connectors in outdoor applications, they must be
separately protected against environmental influences.
• Assembled products may not be manipulated or improperly opened.
• Only use mating connectors that are specified in the technical data
of the standards listed (e.g. the ones listed in the product accessories
online at phoenixcontact.com/products).
• When using the product in direct connection with third-party
manufacturers, the user is responsible.
• For operating voltages > 50 V AC, conductive connector housings must
be grounded
• Ensure that when laying the cable, the tensile load on the connectors
does not exceed the upper limit specified in the standards.
• Observe the corresponding technical data. You will find information: 
o On the product 
o On the packing label 
o In the supplied documentation 
o Online at phoenixcontact.com/products under the product
• Only use tools recommended by Phoenix Contact
• Use a protective cap to protect connectors that are not in use. The
suitable accessories are available online in the accessory section of the
product at phoenixcontact.com/products
• Ensure that the protective or functional ground has been properly
connected.
• VDE 0100/1.97 § 411.1.3.2 and DIN EN 60 204/11.98 § 14.1.3 are
applicable when combining several circuits in a cable and/or connector
• The connector warms up in normal operation. Depending on the
ambient conditions, the surface of the connector can continue to warm
up. In this case, the user is responsible for posting warnings (e.g. DIN
EN ISO 13732-1:2008-12).
