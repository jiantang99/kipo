PRODUCT INFORMATION
CIRCULAR CONNECTORS WITH PUSH-PULL LOCKING  
IN METAL CONNECTOR PLUG HOUSING
PRODUCT INFORMATION
VERSATILE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
There are 6 sizes, 3 termination types and 
a great variety of various contact inserts to 
choose from.
ODU MINI-SNAP is the ideal self-locking circular connector for a wide range 
of applications. Whether used for transmitting power, signals, data or other 
media, this circular connector in its robust metal connector plug housing 
impresses customers with its exceptional quality, high reliability and ideal 
handling characteristics.
The Push-Pull principle reliably ensures that the connector will not come 
loose during application in practice: Once plugged in, the ODU MINI-SNAP 
locks itself into the receptacle automatically. It cannot be separated by 
pulling on the cable. Instead, the connector can easily be separated from the 
receptacle by pulling on the outer housing.
The ODU MINI-SNAP is available in a wide range of sizes and models. In addi-
tion, you can choose between three base codings.

PRODUCT INFORMATION
FUNCTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF  
THE PUSH-PULL LOCKING
You can read about the precise functioning of 
the locking mechanism in the relevant series.
Push-Pull locking systems have a highly user-friendly locking mechanism. 
When the connector is mated with the receptacle, the connector’s locking fi -
gers (1) will lock into place in the receptacle and form a dependable connec-
tion between both parts. It cannot be separated by pulling on the connector’s 
cable (2). Instead, the connector can easily be separated from the receptacle 
by pulling on the outer housing (3). Push-pull connectors from ODU are avail-
able in 6 different standard sizes with diameters from 6.4 mm to 25 mm.

RECEPTACLE
PLUG

Connector

Pulling on the cable or back 
nut will lock the “fi gers” 
firm y in place in the recep-
tacle’s locking groove. This 
prevents the connector 
from being disconnected.
But pulling on the outer 
housing will cause the 
fi gers to emerge from the 
locking groove, making 
it easy to disconnect the 
connector.

THE LP LOCKING PRINCIPLE SERIES K
RECEPTACLE
PLUG
Connector  
in unmated condition
Locking groove
Grounding ring
Locking fingers (“jaws”)
Outer housing
Back nut
Connector  
in mated condition
Pulling on the cable or back 
nut will lock the “fi gers” 
firm y in place in the recep-
tacle’s locking groove. This 
prevents the connector 
from being disconnected.
But pulling on the outer 
housing will cause the 
“fi gers” to emerge from 
the locking groove, making 
it easy to disconnect the 
connector.

PRINCIPLE OF WATERTIGHTNESS  
WITH ODU MINI-SNAP®
ODU makes both IP 50 and IP 68 in the L and B series in the same diameter. For reasons of compatibility with  
the competition, ODU now offers the series K as well, which has a greater diameter than the non-watertight  
model (series L).

All IP 68 submersible ODU MINI-SNAP connectors 
have a rated water depth of 2 m (0.2 bar) for 24 
hours in accordance with IEC 60529:2013 (VDE 
0470-1:2014). A watertight connector requires a 
sealing in a cable collet system. 
The sleeve must fit over the cable precisely. The 
cable jacket must be smooth, cylindrical and free 
of grooves. The connector should be encapsulated 
to make it watertight when not mated.

1  The following applies to the contacts: the contacts are protected in cases 1, 2 and 3 when mated. When not mated, the contacts are only 
protected by a protective cover (see page 69 for series L, page 110 for series K and page 148 for series B) which must be removed before 
mating. 2  The cable seal with elastic disks requires coordination with the cable. Decisive factors: Diameter tolerance, roundness, 
 cable structure, cable jacket hardness.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
TERMINATION TECHNOLOGIES
Insulators with pin contacts fit into the receptacle (or in-line receptacle) as well as into the plug. The same 
applies to insulators with socket contacts. In general, insulators with socket contacts are installed in the live 
part (to provide protection from accidental touch). 
The means of mounting the contacts in the insulator is important on account of the termination technologies. 
Termination technologies for ODU MINI-SNAP connectors include: soldering, crimping and PCB.
SOLDER TERMINATION
CRIMP-CLIP-CONTACT FOR PEEK INSULATOR
PRINT TERMINATION
TERMINATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR TURNED CONTACTS
Solder termination
The contacts are mounted in the insulator before the single connectors are assembled.  
An insulator with pre-installed contacts is referred to as a contact insert. 
Crimp termination 
Here, the individual contact is connected to the individual wires via deformation in the termination area. Then 
the contacts are individually installed in the insulator. Accordingly, insulators and individual contacts – and not 
complete contact inserts – are supplied for the crimp termination. The contact processing for the production of 
connecting cables via crimping creates a secure, durable and corrosion-free contact. Cold compaction (crimping) 
compresses the conductor and contact material to the press points so as to form a gas-tight connection with 
tensile strength to fit the conductor material. 8-point deformation is generally used for turned crimp contacts.

The American Wire Gauge (AWG) is based on the principle that 
the cross-section of the wire changes by 26% from one gauge 
number to the next. The AWG numbers decrease as the wire di-
ameter increases, while the AWG numbers increase as the wire 
diameter decreases. This only applies to solid wire.

However, stranded wire is predominately used in practice. This 
has the advantage of a longer service life under bending and vi-
bration as well as greater fl exibility in comparison with solid wire.

Stranded wires are made of multiple, smaller-gauge wires 
(higher AWG number). The stranded wire then receives the AWG 
numbers of a solid wire with the next closest cross-section to 
that of the stranded wire. In this case, the cross-section of the 
stranded wire refers to the sum of the copper cross-sections of 
the individual wires.

Accordingly, strands with the same AWG number but diff erent 
numbers of wires diff er in cross-section. For instance, an AWG 
20 strand of 7 AWG 28 wires has a cross-section of 0.563 mm2, 
while an AWG 20 strand of 19 AWG 32 wires has a cross-section 
of 0.616 mm2.

The wire cross-section shown in the legend was connected as test cable. In the case of 
multi-position connectors and cables, the heating is greater than it is with individual con-
tacts. For that reason, it is calculated with a reduction factor.  
For connectors, the reduction factors for multi-core cables pursuant to VDE 0298-4:2013 
are applied. The reduction factor is factored in at 5 live wires and up.

Acc. SAE AS 13441:2004 method 3001.1
The values specified in the catalog correspond to SAE AS 13441:2004 method 3001.1. The table values were 
determined according to EIA 364-20E:2015. The inserts were tested while mated, and the test current was applied 
to the pin insert. 
75 % of the dielectric withstanding voltage is used for the further calculation. The operating voltage is 1/3 of this value.
All tests were conducted at normal indoor climate and apply up to an altitude of 2,000 m. If there are any  
deviations, the reduction factors are to be factored in according to the applicable standards. Test voltage: 
Dielectric withstanding voltage × 0.75 Operating voltage: Dielectric withstanding voltage × 0.75 × 0.33
ATTENTION:
With certain applications, the safety requirements for electrical devices are very strict in terms of operating volt-
age. In such cases, the operating voltage is defi ed according to the clearance and creepage distances between 
parts which could be touched.
When selecting such a connector, please contact us and let us know the safety standard which the product must meet.

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) concerns more than just devices and electronic circuits. In the age of networks 
and data communication, connecting elements such as cables and connectors are also very important. Interference 
signals penetrating the connector from outside corrupt data signals and can cause significant system malfunctions. 
This can be reliably avoided with high-grade shielding for the cables and connectors. In order to give our customers 
certainty when using ODU MINI-SNAP connectors, we’ve had a size 3 connector measured by an accredited EMC labora-
tory to determine its EMC quality. Since the sizes 0, 1 and 2 are identical to this connector in structure, just propor-
tionally reduced in size, the values for shielding attenuation are the same.
The measurement was conducted according to the injection or parallel wire method pursuant to VG 95214-11:2002. 
The connector pair is connected to the receiver of a network analyzer on one end, while the other end receives an ad-
justed termination resistor. The injection wire is attached as closely as possible along the connector pair. A flat cable 
is usually used here, since an optimum adjustment can be achieved by attaching more or fewer wires. High-frequency 
signals in the 10 kHz to 3 GHz range are now fed in through the injection wire. The network analyzer measures the 
energy irradiated through the connector plug housing and into the connector, providing a shielding attenuation factor 
as the logarithmic performance ratio AT in dB. The important thing with this method is that all supply lines (especially 
the ones to the connector pair) must be very well shielded so that no interference signals can penetrate the meas-
urement system and corrupt the measured values. This provides the shielding attenuation in dB as a curve over the 
logarithmically applied frequency.
Network analyzer
 
Attenuater 20 dB
Users frequently demand a shielding attenuation better  
than –55 dB (based on a requirement of Deutsche Post).  
It is clear that our connector meets this requirement over  
the entire measurement range.
