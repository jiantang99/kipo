Amphenol LTW Technology expands its coverage 
targeting the marine industry that features the 
NMEA 2000 standard.
The NMEA 2000 standard contains the require-

inter-connect marine electronic equipment on 
share data, including commands and status with 
other compatible equipment over a status with 
other compatible equipment over a single channel.
