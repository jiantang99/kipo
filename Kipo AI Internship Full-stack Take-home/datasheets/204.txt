CSM_XS2_DS_E_5_1
Water- and Environment-resistive FA 
Connectors Save Wiring and Maintenance 
Effort
• Compact FA connectors meet IP67 requirements and ensure a 
94V-0 fire retardant rating.
• A wide array of connectors makes a wiring system more modular, 
simplifies maintenance, and reduces downtime.
• Connectors with Cables and Connector Assemblies are available.
• Three types of Connector Assembly: Crimping, soldering, and 
screw-on.
• Connectors with Cables are UL certified.
• Based on IEC61076-2-101 (IEC 60947-5-2) and NECA 4202.
Refer to Safety Precautions on page 20.

6±0.5 *A
(1) Connector and Cable External Diameters
• Connectors for 6-, 4-, and 3-mm-diameter Cables (i.e., 
Cables that are 5 to 6, 4 to 5, and 3 to 4 mm in diameter 
respectively) are available. When assembling a Connector 
used with a cable, make sure that the external diameter of 
the Connector is suited to that of the cable.
• Connectors for 6-mm-diameter Cables use white cable 
clamps. Connectors for 4- and 3-mm-diameter Cables use 
black cable clamps.
A watertight bushing for 6-mm-diameter Cable has no 
stripe, that for 4-mm-diameter Cable has a single stripe, and 
that for 3-mm-diameter Cable has two stripes.
Note: When connecting a commercially available cable to a connector 
assembly, use a cable with an outside diameter of 3 to 6 mm and core 
sizes of 0.18 to 0.75 mm2 for crimping connectors and 0.5 mm2 maximum 
for soldering connectors.
(2) Component Insertion
• Strip 10 mm of the Cable sheath and 4 mm of each core.
• Before soldering cores and solder cup pins together, solder-
coat each of them.
• The following conditions are recommended for soldering 
each solder cup pin.
Soldering iron: 30 to 60 W
Soldering temperature: 280°C to 340°C
Soldering period: 3 s max.
• The length marked *A should be 6.5 mm max., otherwise 
the proper degree of protection of the connector will not be 
maintained.

• Strip 14 mm of the Cable sheath and 4 mm of each core.
• Make sure that each core is not damaged and its end 
strands are not spread out.
• Mount the XY2F-0003 Locator to XY2F-0002 Crimping 
Tool, both of which are sold separately, and set the selector 
dial of the Crimping Tool to 8.
• After mounting the crimping pins to the Locator, fully insert 
the cores to the crimping pins.
• Squeeze the handle of the Crimp Tool to press-fit the cores 
to the crimping pins.
(Squeeze the handle firmly until the handle automatically 
returns to the release position.)

Cover lock
Do not use the product in atmospheres or environments that 
exceed product ratings.
Tightening Cap (Connector Assemblies)
1. Do not use pliers to tighten caps, otherwise the caps may 
be damaged. Be sure to tighten each cap by hand within a 
torque range between 0.39 and 0.49 N·m.
2. If caps are not tightened securely, the Connectors may not 
maintain their proper degree of protection (i.e., IP67) or the 
caps may become loose due to vibration.
• Align the triangular marks on the pin block and cover and 
insert the pin block into the cover.
• Press them together firmly (0.39 to 0.49 N·m) until the pin 
block does not come out of the cover.
(5) Mounting Cap
• After mounting the cover to the pin block and the cover 
snaps into place, tighten the cap securely by hand within a 
torque of 0.39 and 0.49 N·m.
Note: If the cap is not tighten securely enough, the degree of protection (IP67) 
may not be maintained or vibration may cause the cap to become loose. 
Do not tighten the cap with pliers or similar tools; they may damage the 
cap.
Connector Connection and Disconnection
• When connecting or disconnecting Connectors, be sure to 
hold the Connectors by hand. 
• Do not hold the cable part when disconnecting Connectors.
• Connectors mating with sockets must be fully inserted into 
the sockets. Tighten the thread bracket carefully so that the 
threads will not be damaged.
• Fully tighten thread bracket within a torque range between 
0.39 and 0.49 N·m and be sure that the threads of the 
opposite parts are hidden by the thread bracket.
• When disconnecting Connectors, be sure to loosen the 
thread brackets first. Do not loosen the caps.
• Thread brackets must be loosened in the cutout direction.

(6) After Assembly
• Confirm the insulation between cores after completing 
assembly.
Recommended Cables
Degree of Protection
• Do not impose external force continuously on the joints of 
pin blocks and covers, otherwise the Connectors may not 
keep its proper degree of protection (i.e., IP67).
• The degree of protection of connectors (IP67) is not for a 
fully watertight structure. Do not use them underwater.
• Connectors are of resin mold construction. Do not impose 
excessive force on them.
When connecting a commercially available cable to a 
connector assembly, use a cable with an outside diameter of 
3 to 6 mm and core sizes of 0.18 to 0.75 mm2 for crimping 
connectors and 0.5 mm2 maximum for soldering connectors.
Setup
• Do not make any cable bends near the base of the Unit.
• Any bends made must have a minimum radius of 40 mm.
Connector Arrangement
For safety, when constructing a connection system between a 
Sensor and panel with a connector, make sure that the 
connector plug is on the Sensor side and the connector socket 
is on the panel side (i.e., the female pins are located on the 
power-supply side).
