crimping lugs should be directed upwards, according to the drawing.
• Put the stripped wire in the crimping part until it comes in contact with the
stopper plate. Make sure that no strands stick out of the crimping part.
• Squeeze the plier handles until a final click sounds, release, the pliers should
open by themselves.
• Check the overall aspect of the crimping.

• Push the cable into the contact barrel and make sure the cable strands stick out
of the inspection hole.
Machined Crimping Contacts 
(#16 and #20)
• The pliers must be used on the jaws side.
• Squeeze the plier handles until a final click sounds, release, the pliers should
open by themselves.
• Insert both wire and contact (or wire, reducing sleeve and contact) between the
4 jaws until stopped by the locator.
• Fully squeeze until a final click sounds, the pliers should open once the crimping
is performed
• Extract the wire and crimped contact, then check the overall aspect of the
crimping.

Stripping Instructions
Use the upmost care with stripping operation :
• Use stripping pliers appropriate for the cable gauge and which are in perfect condition.
• In order to obtain a correct crimping and to maintain all of the connector sealing characteristics, the wires must have the dimensions described below.

Then, follow the normal stripping instructions :
- single wire with machined crimping contacts,
- single wire with stamped and formed crimping contacts

Clipper Industrial Plastic Connectors
Instruction For Assembly
Insertion and extraction of contacts
Single wires
Contact insertion and extraction is performed without a tool thanks to te retainer plate system.
Insertion
Extraction
1) With the thumb and index finger, squeeze the
retainer plate flaps and pull backwards : the plate is
then in 
the unlocked position.
1) With the thumb and index finger, squeeze the
retainer plate flaps and pull backwards : the plate is
then in 
the unlocked position.
2) Fully insert the wired contact in the cavity.
2) Pull the contact wire: the the contact comes out of
the cavity.
3) Repeat the same procedure for the other contacts.
3) Repeat the same procedure for the other contacts.
4) Once again squeeze the retainer plate flaps and
push forwards: the plate is then locked and retains
the contacts (90 N of retention force for contacts of
1.6 mm dia.)
5) The plate can only be pushed backed if the
contacts are correctly engaged (backup security)
Special case of jacketed cables
1) Locate the first contact and the corresponding cavity.
Special case of jacketed cables
2) The wire should described a buckle as describe below.
7) Manually fully screw the adaptor and the backshell on the connector.
3) Unlock the retainer plate as described above.
Caution : In the sealed version don’t forget the O-ring.
4) Fully insert the wired contact in the cavity.
8) Push forwards the cable of 10 mm in the backshell.
5) Respect the same procedure for the other contacts
9) Fully screw on the backshell with a wrench while keeping the adaptor
with another wrench.
6) Once again squeeze the retainer plate flaps and push forwards : the
plate is then locked
Note : The plate can only be pushed back if the contacts are correctly
engaged (backup- security)

Clipper Industrial Plastic Connectors
Instruction For Assembly
Adaptor and PG electrical thread backshells
Heat shrink boot
Shrink sleeve as follows :
The CLIPPER connector must be equipped with an adaptor in order
to use a PG electrical thread backshell (e.g.: cable clamp or sealing
gland, or flexible conduits system backshells, etc.)
1) Use heat gun with an air deflector nozzle.
2) Adjust air deflector opening to accommodate tubing size. Turn
switch ON. Wait until full heat output is reached.
1) Manually, fully screw the adaptor on the
connector, the hexagonal nut towards the
rear.
2) In 
the 
sealed 
version, 
cover 
the 
O-ring.
3) Position the air deflector over section of tubing to be shrunk.
Start at pre-shrunk section and work towards open end.
4) When tubing begins to shrink, move gun so that air is distributed
in a band around the tubing circumference causing it to shrink
evenly around the cable.
3) Manually, fully screw the PG thread backshell
of your choice.
5) Move nozzle to adjacent section and shrink in the same manner.
Repeat process on section at a time until entire length is shrunk.
Avoid excessive heat. Direct heat away from connector assembly
to prevent damage.
Note: In the case of an elbow backshell, it is
possible to adjust the position according to the
angle desired.
Instruction 
for polarizing connector mounting
Grommet Backshell Assembly
CP16SW9700
When the insert is partially filled with contacts, place polarization
contact into selected hole location in the FEMALE INSERT and
push in until seated.
• Polarization contacts are used to provide keying capabilities for
the CLIPPER series.
• Polarization contacts are used in the socket-cavities of standard
plugs and reverse receptacles.
1) Position the O-ring at the bottom of the backnut.
2) Run the backnut around the cable.
In order to lock the couple of chosen connectors, you have to let
free the cavity in front of the polarization contact.
3) Unlock the retainer plate.
To avoid the connection with other connectors, you have to insert a
contact in the cavity in front of the polarization contact.
4) Position the grommet in the thrust ring, resting against the
retainer plate.
5) Insert the contacts through the grommet and the retainer plate.
6) Lock the retainer plate.
7) Screw the backshell.
