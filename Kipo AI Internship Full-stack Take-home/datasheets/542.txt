Amphenol  Miniature Cylindrical Connectors
Proprietary/MIL-C-26482, Series 1
Amphenol® Miniature Cylindrical connectors offer twice the number of contacts in just half the size of a Standard connector. These 
miniature connectors, are available in several series, each with varying design characteristics and customer options to meet cost con-
siderations and provide maximum design flexibility. There are two styles within the family that are MS approved and qualified to MIL-
C-26482, Series 1, and in addition there are several proprietary styles.
Common features of all styles:
• All are for general duty applications and environmental sealing is achieved with the grommet and clamp design.
• Operating temperature is from –55°C to +125°; Operating voltage to 1000 VAC (RMS) at sea level.
• Pin and socket contacts are machined from low loss copper alloy and gold plated to eliminate contact corrosion and provide an 
indefinite shelf life.

Amphenol  Miniature Cylindrical
design flexibility
The large family of miniature proprietary and MS style connectors provides for 
many optional features and designs. In addition to the choices of bayonet or 
threaded shells, solder or crimp termination within the style variations, there are 
additional options that are shown here.
Hermetics
Hermetically sealed receptacles have fused compression glass sealed 
inserts which provide envionrmental moisture sealing. There are three 
hermetic styles within the PT bayonet series and three hermetic styles 
within the PC threaded series.
26482 Connector with PC Tail
Contacts
26482 Connector with Hermetic 
Seal Insert and Coax Contacts
Coaxial Contacts
Amphenol Miniature connectors can incorporate shielded coax
contacts. Size 8 and 12 crimp coax contacts are available in PT-SE,
SP-SE, MS/PT-SE. Factory installed size 8 and 12 solder type coax
contacts are available in PT, SP,MS/PT connectors. See coax contact
information pages at the end of this catalog.
Printed Circuit Board Tail Contacts
PT bayonet connectors in box mounting receptacle and jam nut receptacle styles are avail-
able with printed circuit board contacts. Standard PCB tails for MIL-C-26482 connectors 
have gold plating, .0050 inches over nickel. See page 20 and call Amphenol for further infor-
mation.
26482 Connector with Flex
Flex Circuitry
Flex termination assemblies for attaching cylindrical connectors to printed circuit boards are 
available through the Amphenol division ACT, Advanced Circuit Technology. Flex can be 
used with miniature 26482 connectors and it can be designed to meet specific length, current 
carrying capacity and to fit the precise geometric shape of the connector to board package. 
Flex circuity plugs into a printed circuit board and creates a self-locking terminal pad which 
eliminates the need for an additional interconnect to the PCB.
Breakaway, Twist Pull Miniatures
Quick disconnect “breakaway” styles are shown in this catalogs. These are available in PT
solder style plugs (page 26), PT-SE crimp style plugs (page 38) or PT-CE crimp style plugs 
(page 48). Quick disconnect of the connector plug from the receptacle is accomplished with 
axial pull on the lanyard. This instant decoupling and damage free separation is ideal for 
weapons release and blind or difficult accessibility situations. Separation forces vary per 
connector series. The plug and receptacle need to be fully mated before disengagement by 
the lanyard pull.
Breakaway Twist Pull 26482
Filter Protection
Amphenol offers the FPT Series which combines the miniature PT 
series with an EMI filter. Designed to provide EMI protection for 
sensitive circuits, each circuit is individually filtered within the con-
nector, eliminating the need for costly and bulky exterior network
filters. Filter contacts are available in MF, HF, VHF, and UHF 
ranges and are intermateable and intermountable with MIL-C-
26482 connectors. For further information see catalog 12-120, 
Amphenol EMI Filter Transient Protection Connectors. (online at 
www.amphenol-aerospace.com).

Filter Protection
26482 Connector with Overmolded 
Cable
Overmolded Cable
Overmold seals and cables can be designed for almost any industrial application. A variety 
of materials are available: neoprene, hypalon and others; and a variety of lengths can be 
designed to meet customer specifications. Overmold seals to the rear of the connector and 
to the cable jacket providing moisture sealing.

Alternate Positioning
To avoid cross-plugging problems in applications requiring 
the use of more than one miniature cylindrical connector of 
the same size and arrangement, alternate insert rotations 
are available as indicated in the accompanying chart.
As shown in the diagram at right, the front face of the pin 
insert is rotated within the shell in a clockwise direction from 
the normal shell key. The socket insert would be rotated 
counterclockwise the same number of degrees in respect to 
the normal shell key.

Amphenol  PT, SP, MS/PT
Proprietary/MIL-C-26482, Series 1
bayonet coupling and solder termination
Amphenol® solder contact miniature cylindrical connectors 
meet the most critical application needs. Design versatility 
combined with high reliability performance makes these 
series of Miniature Cylindrical Connectors ideal for environ-
mental sealing or pressurized applications.

The MS/PT Series is qualified to MIL-C-26482, Series 1 and has 
all the outstanding design characteristics and quality of the PT 
Series. The SP Series is a modification of the PT, providing special 
shells with a wide mounting flange for back panel mounting.
A corrosion resistant electrically conductive finish of cadmium 
plate with an olive drab chromate after-treatment is used on the PT 
and MS/PT. The SP is given a durable non-conductive hard anodic 
“Alumilite”® coating which provides abrasion protection and resis-
tance to corrosion.
Shell components for these series are aluminum. The dependable 
5 key/keyway polarization with bayonet lock coupling assures pos-
itive mating with no chance of cross plugging. Spring tension pro-
vided by a wave washer in the coupling nut ensures maintenance 
of interfacial seal between mating halves.
Both the insert and main joint gasket are molded from resilient 
neoprene. This provides excellent moisture sealing at the gasket 
and superior electrical isolation of the contact in the insert.
Both pins and sockets are machined from a copper alloy and are 
gold plated. This gold plating eliminates contact corrosion and 
offers an indefinite shelf life. Socket contacts for these series are a 
closed entry design. A breakaway style plug is available in the PT 
solder series. Hermetics receptacles are available in PT and MS/
PT solder series. Receptacles with printed circuit board contacts 
are also available. 
PT Solder is UL recognized under file #E115497, Vol. 1, Sec. 5.
The PT, SP and MS/PT Series are intermateable and intermount-
able with all existing Miniature Cylindrical Series connectors 
except for the threaded coupling PC Series.
Refer to pages 4-11 for insert arrangement availability.

Amphenol PT-SE, SP-SE, MS/PT-SE
Proprietary/MIL-C-26482, Series 1
bayonet coupling and crimp termination
Amphenol® SE crimp type miniature connectors provide 
performance and versatility needed for applications 
demanding high reliability and crimp removable contacts. 
These crimp contacts are rear insertable/front release and 
are held in position by an MS approved spring tower reten-
tion system.

The MS/PT-SE Series is qualified to MIL-C-26482, Series 1 and 
has all the outstanding design characteristics and quality of the 
PT Series.
The SP-SE Series is a modification of the PT-SE, providing 
special shells with a wide mounting flange for back panel 
mounting.
A corrosion resistant electrically conductive finish of cadmium 
plate with an olive drab chromate after-treatment is used on the 
PT-SE and MS/PT-SE. The SP-SE is given a durable non-con-
ductive hard anodic “Alumilite”® coating which provides abra-
sion protection and resistance to corrosion.
Shell components for these series are aluminum. The depend-
able 5 key/keyway polarization with bayonet lock coupling 
assures positive mating with no chance of cross plugging. 
Spring tension provided by a wave washer in the coupling nut 
ensures maintenance of interfacial seal between mating halves.
Both the insert and main joint gasket are molded from resilient 
neoprene. This provides excellent moisture sealing at the gas-
ket and superior electrical isolation of the contact in the insert.
Both pins and sockets are machined from a copper alloy and 
are gold plated. This gold plating eliminates contact corrosion 
and offers an indefinite shelf life. Socket contacts for these 
series are a closed entry design.
Breakaway style plug is available in PT-SE crimp. 
The PT-SE, SP-SE and MS/PT-SE Series are intermateable 
and intermountable with all existing Miniature Cylindrical Series 
connectors except for the threaded coupling PC Series.

Amphenol  PT-CE, SP-CE
bayonet coupling, crimp termination
Amphenol® CE crimp type miniature connectors provide 
performance and versatility needed for applications 
demanding high reliability and crimp removable contacts. 
These crimp contacts are rear insertable/front release and 
are held in position by a nylon wafer retention system.

The SP-CE Series is a modification of the PT-CE, providing 
special shells with a wide mounting flange for back panel 
mounting.
A corrosion resistant electrically conductive finish of cadmium 
plate with an olive drab chromate after-treatment is used on the 
PT-CE. The SP-CE is given a durable nonconductive hard 
anodic “Alumilite”® coating which provides abrasion protection 
and resistance to corrosion.
Shell components for these versions are aluminum. The 
dependable 5 key/keyway polarization with bayonet lock cou-
pling assures positive mating with no chance of cross plugging. 
Spring tension provided by a wave washer in the coupling nut 
ensures maintenance of interfacial seal between mating halves.
Both the insert and main joint gasket are molded from resilient 
neoprene. This provides excellent moisture sealing at the gas-
ket and superior electrical isolation of the contact in the insert.
Both pins and sockets are machined form a copper alloy and 
are gold plated. This gold plating eliminates contact corrosion 
and offers an indefinite shelf life. Socket contacts for these 
series are a closed entry design.
Breakaway style plug is available in PT-CE crimp.
The PT-CE and SP-CE Series are intermateable and inter-
mountable with all existing Miniature Cylindrical Series connec-
tors except for the threaded coupling PC Series.
Refer to pages 4-11 for insert arrangement availability.

Amphenol  PC
threaded coupling and solder termination
Amphenol® PC Series threaded coupling miniature cylin-
drical connectors incorporate solder contacts. The PC dou-
ble stub threaded coupling system cannot be cross 
threaded, and is mechanically assisted while engaging and 
disengaging.

Shell components are aluminum. Bright cadmium plating to 
QQ-P-416 with a clear chromate after-treatment provides a 
golden colored conductive finish. Single key/keyway polariza-
tion represents maximum simplicity in a design proven in mil-
lions of AN connectors.
Both pins and sockets are machined from a copper alloy and 
are gold plated. This gold plating eliminates contact corrosion 
and offers an indefinite shelf life. Socket contacts for these 
series are a closed entry design.
Both the insert and main joint gasket are molded from resilient 
neoprene. This provides excellent moisture sealing at the gas-
ket and superior electrical insulation of the contacts in the 
insert.
The PC is intermateable and intermountable within the PC 
threaded coupling series.
Refer to pages 4-11 for insert arrangement availability.

*
This connector style is sometimes referred to as a cable connecting “plug”.
It does, however, mate with either a straight or 90 degree plug.
PC-SE and PC-CE, which are threaded coupling and incorporate crimp 
contacts, are briefly covered on pages 62 and 63. It is necessary to 
contact Amphenol for ordering information on these types.

Amphenol® PC-SE Series threaded coupling miniature cylindri-
cal connectors incorporate crimp contacts in a spring tower 
retention system. 
Amphenol® PC-CE Series threaded coupling miniature cylindri-
cal connectors incorporate crimp contacts in a nylon wafer 
retention system to maintain contact position.
The PC double stub threaded coupling system cannot be cross 
threaded, and is mechanically assisted while engaging and dis-
engaging.
PC-SE and PC-CE Service Classes
PC-SE and PC-CE connectors are available in the
three service classes listed below.
“SE”
Open wire sealing - environmental resistant,
with a nut and grommet for moisture proof-
ing individual wires
“SE” (SR)Strain relief clamp - environmental resistant
strain relief clamp and grommet for moisture
proofing individual wires; provides added
wire bundle support
“SP”
Translucent nylon boot for retaining cus-
tomer applied potting compounds; held in
place by a threaded ring
Shell components are aluminum. Bright cadmium plating to QQ-P-
416 with a clear chromate after-treatment provides a golden colored 
conductive finish. Single key/keyway polarization represents maxi-
mum simplicity in a design proven in millions of AN connectors.
Both pins and sockets are machined from a copper alloy and are gold 
plated. This gold plating eliminates contact corrosion and offers an 
indefinite shelf life. Socket contacts for these series are a closed entry 
design.
Both the insert and main joint gasket are molded from resilient neo-
prene. This provides excellent moisture sealing at the gasket and 
superior electrical insulation of the contacts in the insert.
The PC-SE and PC-CE are only intermateable and intermountable 
within the PC threaded coupling series.

Shell style drawing pages are not shown in this catalog for the PC-SE 
and PC-CE styles. If connector drawings are needed please contact 
Amphenol for assistance. Shell styles are currently available in these 
series as follows: 
• PC00-SE, wall mounting receptacle
• PC01-SE, cable connecting receptacle
• PC02-SE, box mounting receptacle
• PC06-SE, straight plug
• PC08-SE, 90 degree plug
• PC06-CE straight plug (will mate with PC-SE receptacles and PC 
solder receptacles)
Please contact Amphenol for complete information, as there may be 
limitations in shell sizes within the PC-SE and PC-CE series.
Refer to pages 4-11 for insert arrangement availability.

Coaxial Contacts
for miniature cylindrical connectors
Amphenol® Miniature Connectors can incorporate shielded coax contacts. 
The Miniature family is built around MIL-C-26482 specifications, with Mil-
approved and proprietary styles offered. Normal operating voltage for Minia-
ture cylindricals with power only contacts is up to 1,000 VAC (RMS) at sea 
level.
Solder Coax Contact
for use in Miniature Solder Type Connectors
Miniature Cylindricals offer these features for contact termination
flexibility:
•
Several insert arrangements that can incorporate:
• Size 8 & 12 Crimp Coax contacts for Crimp type
• Size 8 & 12 Solder Coax contacts for Solder type
•
Wide selection of connector shell styles and sizes
•
Standard power contact options within the various connector styles 
include: solder type, crimp front release, crimp rear release
•
Coax contacts are designed to the same high performance standards as 
power contacts. Coax and power contacts may be intermixed with no deg-
radation of connector reliability.
•
No mis-mating or cross-plugging with insert rotation and keyway
polarization.

GENERAL ORDERING INFORMATION
Amphenol Miniature Cylindricals are normally supplied with a full complement 
of power contacts, separately packaged. Coax contacts are ordered by part 
number as referenced in the part number charts on the following pages of this 
catalog, and are substituted for the power contacts at the time of the cable or 
equipment assembly. If the application is for coax only, the connector may be 
ordered less contacts and no power contacts will be supplied.
Installation instructions for the coax contacts for Miniature Connectors are 
provided in Amphenol documents as follows: L-633 for solder type; L-613 for 
SE type; L-660 for CE type.
CONTACTS
HOW TO ORDER:
A. Select the coax contacts designed for the cable being used from the appli-
cable charts in this catalog for each Miniature type (solder, SE or CE).
B. Select a connector insert from those shown on pages60-63 which will 
accommodate the quantity and size of coaxial contacts needed plus any 
power contacts required. Note: Size 8S and 12S contacts are used with 
connector inserts through shell size 18 only. For larger connector shell 
sizes, use size 8L contacts.
C. Determine the Miniature Cylindrical type, shell style, finish, service class 
and insert rotation required for your application.
D. Consult Amphenol, Sidney NY with the pertinent cable, contact, insert 
arrangement and connector style choices for complete connector part 
number.

Coaxial Contacts
for miniature cylindrical connectors, cont.
Amphenol® Coaxial Contacts designed for use in Miniature Cylindrical Connectors 
offer the same durability advantages and design benefits for reliable interconnection as the 
Amphenol coax contacts used in high performance D38999 connectors. A variety of military 
and commercial shielded cables are accommodated within the miniature cylindrical series. 
Amphenol supplies coax contacts for solder, crimp SE and crimp CE connector styles.
Other features of the coax for miniature cylindricals include:
•
Miniature coax design has an outside nut within the
assembly for fast, reliable assembly of contact to cable.
TYPICAL MINIATURE CRIMP COAX 
SOCKET CONTACT has crimp socket outer 
contact with a solder pin inner contact
•
All types feature solder style inner contacts and crimp 
style outer contacts for reliable cable termination
•
Miniature coax crimp type contacts are designed for use
in Miniature crimp series connectors
•
Miniature coax solder type contacts are designed for
use in Miniature solder series connectors. These
come pre-installed into the solder connector.

TYPICAL ELECTRICAL PERFORMANCE
Size 8 and 12 Coax Contacts
Contact Resistance:
Center @ 1 Amp, 170 millivolts max. voltage drop @ 25°C
Outer @ 12 Amps, 150 millivolts max. voltage drop @ 25°C
Dielectric Withstanding Voltage:
Size 8: 1,300 VAC Rms @ sea level
Size 12: 1,000 VAC Rms @ sea level
Size 8 & 12: 250 VAC Rms @ 50,000 ft.
Insulation Resistance
5,000 megohms minimum @ 25°C
Typical VSWR for size 8 & 12 PT-SE Types II & III only:

EXPLANATION OF TYPE CLASSIFICATIONS:
PT-SE Type I is moisture seal design with internal O-ring.
PT-SE Type II is 50 ohm impedance matched version. Contacts ter-
minated to other than 50 ohm cables are therefore not matched.
PT-SE Type III is 50 ohm contact, non-serviceable after assembly
Solder and CE Types are non-impedance matched contacts.

FLANGE MOUNTED CONNECTORS
All flange mounting PC and PT connectors use standard MS 
mounting dimensions. They cannot be back panel mounted 
due to coupling clearance. The PTB (thru-bulkhead) type con-
nector must also be back panel mounted on one side. Flange 
gaskets are available for both series, see page 64.

JAM NUT MOUNTINGS
F
JAM NUT MOUNTINGS
The jam nut design has become very popular because it allows 
bench wiring of harness assemblies. The labor saving often off-
sets the added cost of the jam nut receptacle which is due to 
the self contained “O” ring and the extra nut. The PC series 
mounts in a round hole and can be pinned to prevent rotation. 
The PT series mounts in a “D” mounting hole and does not 
require pinning.

The finish of each of these hermetic 
receptacles is fused electro-deposited 
tin for easy solderability, and protected 
by a special lacquer for optimum shelf 
life. The lacquer will not interfere with 
any soldering operation.
Low temperature solder should be used 
and the addition of a solder fillet at 
arrow points on drawing at right is rec-
ommended. Care must be taken that 
the operating temperature of the final 
assembly does not rise above the melt-
