Current carrying capacity
The current carrying capacity of the connectors is
limited by the thermal load capability of the contact
element material including the connections and the
insulating parts. The derating curve is therefore
valid for currents which flow constantly (non-
intermittent) through each contact element of the
connector evenly, without exceeding the allowed
maximum temperature.
