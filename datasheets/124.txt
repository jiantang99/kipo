MKJ Clip Lock (MKJ CL) Miniature Circular Connector 
Small, Lightweight & Competitively Priced, Our New MKJ CL Connector for Avionics 
& Cabin System Applications utilizes a Clip Lock Latching System.
The CANNON Difference
• Smaller, lighter design packages and configurations
• Committed partner for off-the-shelf or custom 
    interconnect solutions 
• High performance and reliability in the 
 harshest environments
The Challenge
Today’s commercial aerospace manufacturers are 
increasingly challenged to meet the ongoing demand for 
lighter, high reliability interconnect solutions that support 
a wide range of modernized Avionics and Cabin System 
applications. From high speed data and signal transfer 
for IFE/C, to glass cockpit functionality and aircraft 
environmental lighting, there is an increasing need for 
small, lightweight and competitively priced electrical 
connectors that deliver the highest level of performance, 
no matter the conditions or environment.   
Key Product Features
The Solution
ITT Cannon’s new MKJ Clip Lock (MKJ CL) miniature 
circular connector offers an ideal solution for today’s 
connectivity needs. Our smaller, lighter MKJ CL 
interconnect features an innovative clip lock latching 
system that we repurposed from a design originally 
used for the automotive industry. By eliminating higher 
cost components, we transformed it into a mil-style 
connector with a proven snap on positive lock dimension 
that is both robust and competitively priced.    
• Easy-to-use and install with quick connect 
 clip lock feature
• Multiple keying options prevent mismating  
 
 with 6 clocking positions  
 
• Available with diverse contact options 
 - high-density size 23, size 20HD, size 16 
 or size 12 machined contacts
•  Fully machined aluminium or stainless steel shells
• Field repairable
• Plating: Electroless Nickel, Olive Drab   
 
 Cadmium Black Zinc Nickel and Teflon Nickel
