AMPHENOL WARRIOR GRIP & WARRIOR-LOK SERIES
World's only 10 Amp Connector Fully Compatible with Nett Warrior Products
PDS - 317
10 
AMPS
AMPHENOL’S WARRIOR GRIP SERIES IS THE ONLY NETT WARRIOR-STYLE CONNECTOR TO BRING 
FAST CHARGING 10 AMP CAPABILITY DIRECTLY TO THE WARFIGHTER 
Leveraging Amphenol’s extensive experience with the 2M804 push-pull series, Warrior Grip connectors are designed to 
offer a solution that exceeds the rigorous requirements of the US Army’s Nett Warrior program. The Warrior Grip series 
brings with it a number of enhancements to the standard 2M804 design, including a unique mate-force rating for even 
quicker disconnect and selectively plated shells for improved conductivity. With these enhancements, the Warrior Grip 
series is tailor made for nearly any soldier-worn application.
When paired with our 10 Amp Warrior Grip Socket Contact system, you can get even more power out of your 
application in the same lightweight package. Designed to push the size #23 contact to new limits without the downside 
of excessive heat rise, the Warrior Grip socket contact system is fully backwards compatible with existing size #23 pin 
designs. The system yields an average 26% improvement in heat rise when compared to the competition, and meets 
all applicable MIL-STD-1472 temperature exposure limits.*
