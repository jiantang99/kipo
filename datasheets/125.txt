NANO PEGASUS
 Small, easy to use connectors that provide exceptional 
performance in tight spaces.

NANO PEGASUS
Overview
Nano-Pegasus & Nano-Luminus build upon APCD’s success in light weight, plastic circular connectors in the aerospace 
market, in a very small way. Nano-Pegasus & Nano-Luminus are small, plastic, easy to use connectors designed 
specifically for sensing, command and control applications where a Micro or Nano Dsub would be used. Nano-Pegasus & 
Nano-Luminus provide exceptional performance in tight spaces, packing 11 high grade contacts in a shell size 5 housing 
(0.325” outer diameter). That’s equivalent to 132 contacts per square inch! Contacts are rated for 1a, 350 Vdc operation. 
With 0.050” spacing, this gives 500 Vdc insulation resistance, and 350 Vac dielectric withstanding at 70k feet.
Scoop proof construction and enclosed contacts protect the small gauge contacts during mating. When mated, IP67 
sealing is guaranteed by the interfacial seal, helping ensure the contacts are free from dust, moisture and corrosion. 
And unlike many of the competitive connectors, which are multi-piece assemblies, Nano-Pegasus & Nano-Luminus shells 
are a single piece housing, impervious to humidity and dust, further enhancing clean, crack free operations over the full 
operating temperature and environmental conditions. Shells are a high grade polyethermide construction, providing a 
temperature range of -65C to +175C, and high mating cycles, making Nano-Luminus suitable for man/machine interfaces. 
Nano-Pegasus adds a copper & nickel overplate, providing 40db to 60db EMI shielding.
Available in solder cup for user assembly or as a finished good pig tail assembly.

NANO PEGASUS
Applications
• 
Communications via single and dual USB2.0, CAN Bus, 
USB3.0, CAT5 & CAT6 ethernet, or user defined low and 
medium speed requirements.
• 
Command and Control as typically found in subsystem 
interconnects with user defined high density data and low 
power signaling.
• 
Sensor connectivity, such as found in missile and munition guidance systems, infrared target acquisition and 
tracking gimbels, angle of attack and inertial guidance systems.
• 
Low pin count Micro (M83513) & Nano (M32139) DSub alternative where a circular connector is more appropriate.
More from Amphenol Pcd’s Pegasus Series
Pegasus
The Pegasus Series is Amphenol Pcd’s latest innovation in small, lightweight, rugged connectors.  Designed for use in 
harsh environments, Pegasus builds on the successful Luminus Aerospace connector with the addition of EMI shielding.  
EMI shielding is provided by electroless copper and nickel plate, with a copper alloy spring finger gasket to ensure 
shell-to-shell conductivity. Tests show between 40db and 60db of attenuation, depending on frequency.  This 
combination of light weight, small size, and EMI shielding makes Pegasus the ideal choice where protection against 
ambient noise transients, or suppression of emitted noise is required, and space and weight are at a premium.
Pegasus High Speed
Amphenol Pcd has expanded the capability Pegasus to support industry standard TWINAX and QUADRAX style 
contacts. Pegasus High Speed brings an easy to use, light weight, low cost connection solution to applications that 
have typically relied on heavier, more complicated, and therefore more expensive, metal shell connectors.
Supporting the AS39029/90, /91, /113, /114 Twinax and ARINC600, ARINC404, AS39029/119, /120 Quadrax rear 
release, rear removable, size 8 style contacts, Pegasus High Speed provides exceptional performance in tight spaces, 
with a svelte shell size 8 (0.512”) outer diameter. With the explosive growth in ethernet enabled devices (IOT,) this 
is size and configuration is particularly suited for end point applications, such as individual avionics sensors, panel 
mounted units, seat back and wall mounted displays and monuments.
Scoop proof construction and molded in alignment keys help protect the small gauge contacts during mating. When 
mated, IP67 sealing is guaranteed by the interfacial seal, helping ensure the contacts are free from dust, moisture and 
corrosion. A triple riser grommet sealing boot provides back end sealing on the wire side.
Compatibility with standard Pegasus shell sizes means many of the currently available tape and screw mount cradle 
accessories are supported, easing installation and mounting tasks.
