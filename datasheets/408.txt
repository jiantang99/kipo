Micro-BTM Product Introduction
Amphenol Industrial offers a high performance circular connector product range developed for industrial applications 
where electrical performance must be met with affordability. High mating cycles, along with the ability to operate in difficult 
environments are the benchmark of rugged connectors. Amphenol’s new Micro-Bayonet series provides the solution that 
meets your budget and performance goals. 
Made from an aluminum shell, Micro-B utilizes a robust triple bayonet coupling (1/4 turn mating) mechanism and stamped & 
formed contacts. Various mounting options are available including in-line and 2-hole flange mount configurations.
Micro-B meets the requirements of today’s electrical equipment for a connector with a small footprint, light in 
weight, high density insert patterns, and high reliability.
Micro-B meets all RoHS requirements. With Gray ZnNi 
Plating, Micro-B can withstand up to 500 hours salt spray 
without corrosion detrimental to its operation.

As shown in the diagram to the left, the front face of the plug shell is 
rotated in a clockwise direction from the normal shell keying position. 
The receptacle shell is rotated counterclockwise the same number of 
degrees in respect to the normal shell key position.

A plug with a given rotation letter will mate with a receptacle with the 
same rotation letter. The degree angles for a given connector are 
the same whether it contains pin or socket. Inserts are not rotated in 
conjunction with the master key/keyway.
