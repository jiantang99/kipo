POWERSAFE
PowerSafe MIL-DTL-38999 Series III was developed to transfer high power (500V voltage) in harsh 
environment, with a full safety for the user.
Main Features
  Qualified VG96944
  Focus both on USER SAFETY and on the MIL-DTL-38999 Series III performances
USER
SAFETY
  First mate/last break: One protective contact linked to the shell
  Last mate/first break: One pilot contact with breaking capacity. It allows the current flow in the phase and 
neutral contacts through a relay
  IP28 : 
- finger test for socket contacts and socket inserts
- pressure water tight (48h, under 2m water)
Added Benefits
  In accordance with the new standard for power equipment
  Homogeneity with standard MIL-DTL-38999 III connectors when power is needed on the equipment (same 
panel drilling)
   Qualified according the most stringent standard VG96944
   Safety use design following DIN EN-61984 (VDE 0627)
