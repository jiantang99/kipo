Standards and Regulations
• The products are suitable for applications in plant, controller, and
electrical device engineering.
• When operating the connectors in outdoor applications, they must be
separately protected against environmental influences.
• Assembled products may not be manipulated or improperly opened.
• Only use mating connectors that are specified in the technical data
of the standards listed (e.g. the ones listed in the product accessories
online at phoenixcontact.com/products).
• When using the product in direct connection with third-party
manufacturers, the user is responsible.
• For operating voltages > 50 V AC, conductive connector housings must
be grounded
• Ensure that the protective or functional ground has been properly
connected.
• VDE 0100/1.97 § 411.1.3.2 and DIN EN 60 204/11.98 § 14.1.3 are
applicable when combining several circuits in a cable and/or connector
• Only use tools recommended by Phoenix Contact
• The installation notes/Design In documents online on the download
page at phoenixcontact.com/products must be observed for this product.
• Operate the connector only when it is fully plugged in and interlocked.
• Ensure that when laying the cable, the tensile load on the connectors
does not exceed the upper limit specified in the standards.
• Observe the minimum bending radius of the cable. Lay the cable
without twisting it.
• The connector warms up in normal operation. Depending on the
ambient conditions, the surface of the connector can continue to warm
up. In this case, the user is responsible for posting warnings (e.g. DIN
EN ISO 13732-1:2008-12).
