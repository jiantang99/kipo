Notes
General
This product corresponds to the PROFINET Cabling and 
Interconnection Technology Guideline for PROFINET 
regulations, version 2.00, order no: 2.252, Chapter 8.2 
Connectors for Outside Environment (Balanced cabling)
General
NOTE: Observe the permissible bending radii when laying 
conductors, since the degree of protection may be put in 
jeopardy if the bending forces are too high. Alleviate mechanical 
loads upstream of the connector, e.g. by using cable ties.
