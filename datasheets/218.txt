All Front Runner Series contacts are precision machined 
from solid copper alloy barstock.  They are durable, smooth 
in construction, and have greater amperage capacities than 
hollow, sheet metal-style contacts.
 
Front Runner Series contacts, having a large contact 
SECTION A-A
ENLARGED
 surface area, produce less heat at the contact surface, 
 thereby permitting the connector to operate at high  amperage 
 levels continuously and still maintain lower  connector 
 temperatures.
 
All contacts of Positronic’s Front Runner Series utilize the 
“Large Surface Area (L.S.A.) Contact Mating System.”  The 
“L.S.A. Contact Mating System” insures the lowest level 
of contact resistance during mechanical endurance tests of 
1000 coupling cycles or more.  Contact insertion/withdrawal 
forces remain substantially the same during the life of the 
connector.
 
Front Runner Series use only “Closed Entry” design 
female contacts.  The “Closed Entry” design prevents probe 
damage to the female contacts, and will not allow the female 
contact to accept misaligned or bent male contacts.

TECHNICAL DATA
 MATERIAL: Electroless nickel over copper.  Electroless plating 
offers surface conductivity of < 0.5 ohm per square and 
attenuation of 70-80 dB at most frequencies.  Due to 
differences in cable construction and termination, results 
may vary and should be tested under actual operating 
conditions to determine exact values.
* NOTE:  Dimensions are consistent with non-shielded versions.

ADVANTAGES OF REAR INSERTION-FRONT RELEASE
CONTACT RETENTION SYSTEM
CONSIDERATION
FRONT RELEASE ADVANTAGE
  1.  Size
Will accept a wire with oversized insulation diameter.
CONTACTS
  2.  Connector Wiring
Less open wiring is required between the connector and the lacing or between the connector and the 
cable jacket.  Minimum service time is required for repairs.
  3.  Shielded Wires
Provides the most effective RFI shielding as the shielding can be brought closer to the grommet surface 
for terminations to the connector shell.
  4.  Contact Servicing
Since the removal tool is inserted from the front, finding the correct position is relatively simple.
  5.  Wire Breakage
The standard removal tool can be used to remove a contact which has a broken wire at the contact 
crimp joint.
 
 6.  Service Tools
Metal tools are available for inserting and removing contacts.
