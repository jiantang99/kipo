Remarks : 1. The contact arrangement depicts a view from the wiring side.
 
 2.   Installation is accomplished by securing the receptacle from the back side of the panel using the supplied hexagon 
nut. The tightening torque of the hexagon nut should be 0.5 N·m for 3, 6 contacts, and 0.8 N·m for 10, 12 contacts.
In addition, in order to prevent loosening, please apply Locktight 263 and Lockprimer 7649 manufactured by Henkel Japan Ltd., Tokyo.

Prepare the cable end according to the dimensions shown in Table 1.
Note :  When preparing the cable, use caution not to damage the insulation and conductors of the lead wires.

Note 1 :   Take care to avoid creating cold solder joints and solder joints with voids or air holes in it. 
Also check to make sure the solder joint is adequately fused between the lead wires and solder cup.
Note 2 :     The P case block is a precision unit. Please use caution when soldering the P case block so it does not 
become damaged. Any damage could result in loss of the waterproof performance.
Crimp type
After crimping the appropriate contact to the cable lead wire, insert the terminated wire into the correct contact 
position on the P case block.
Note :    After inserting the crimping wire/contact, slightly pull the lead wire and check if the crimping contact is 
properly seated into the P case block.

Insert the cable by fitting the coupling guide to the wire-connected P case block.
Then, pass the cable through and assemble in the following order: 1. spring, gasket, 2 cord clamp, and 3. cord tube.
Make sure when assembling it with the cord clamp and cord tube, to maintain the positional relations between the 
cable sheath end face and the concave area of the gasket as shown in Fig.B.
Note :  Please install the cord tube using the cord tube tightening tool with the cord ring tightening torque shown in 
Table-2.
ln addition, in order to prevent loosening, please apply Locktight 263 and Lockprimer 7649 manufactured 
by Henkel Japan Ltd., Tokyo.
When screwing in the cord tube, use your hand to hold the cable so that the cable will not rotate or twist 
and apply stress to the soldered wires. However, as the cable tends to be twisted slightly (just over one 
rotation), we recommend that you twist it in the opposite direction in advance.

 Points to note when using Heat shrink tubing
We recommend that you use shrink tubing over the solder connections in order to protect the soldered wires and to 
enhance insulation. However, please be careful when applying heat in this area when installing the shrink tube so 
excess heat does not bleed into or affect the resin parts as shown in the figure below.
If the product does become heated beyond the area shown and into the resin parts, please make sure to prevent the 
following.
q Deformation of the C ring. This could result in prevention of locking during mating.
w Melting of some parts.
To prevent the deformation of the C rings of the receptacles and the jack, we recommend heat to be applied after 
mating with a compatible plug.
Before heating, please mate the plug in the receptacle securely, then pull the back shell for checking whether it is 
locked properly. If it is heated with semi-fitting, C ring may be thermally deformed with shrinking condition and it may 
not be locked properly.

 Precautions after wiring (Solder type and Crimp type)
After wiring, do not seal the connected portion with potting, etc.
Potting may cause the O-ring to come off when the applicable plug is removed.
If the connector is used with the O-ring removed, the waterproof performance will not be satisfied.

 Precautions
1.   Make sure the power is off before mating or un-mating the connector.
2.  When mating the connector, push it on with a force of a least 30N.  
After mating, pull slightly on the connector to check for proper mating and to ensure the connector is ﬁ rmly locked to 
the receptacle.
3.  After mating the connector, do not apply a force over 30N to the cable in the directions shown by the arrows. An 
excessive load can lead to connector damage.

4.  To maintain the waterproof performance, cable clamping force and cable stability, please use a cable within the 
recommended for cable diameters.
Because the performance will differ depending on the cable structure, make sure to check all speciﬁ cations of the 
cable assembly before use or production.
5.  Please assemble and install the connector and components with the speciﬁ ed tightening torque. 
If the tightening torque is too weak or too strong, loosening or breakage can occur.
6. Please contact Hirose if your application requires compliance with the Electrical Appliance and Meterial Safety Act.
7. Please note that the white label on the connector may come off due to solvents such as alcohol.
