Water- and Environment-resistive 
FA Connectors Save Wiring and 
Maintenance Effort
• Compact FA connectors meet IP67 requirements and ensure a 
94V-0 fire retardant rating.
• A wide array of connectors makes a wiring system more 
modular, simplifies maintenance, and reduces downtime.
• Connectors with Cables and Connector Assemblies are available.
• Three types of Connector Assembly: Crimping, soldering, and 
screw-on.
• Connectors with Cables are UL certified.
• Based on IEC61076-2-101 (IEC60947-5-2) and NECA 4202.
Refer to Safety Precautions on page 34.

• Connectors for 8, 7, 6, 4, and 3 mm diameter Cables (i.e., 
Cables that are 7 to 8, 6 to 7, 5 to 6, 4 to 5, and 3 to 4 mm in 
diameter respectively) are available.
When assembling a Connector used with a cable, make sure 
that the external diameter of the Connector is suited to that 
of the cable.
• A waterproof bushing for 6/7 mm diameter Cable has no 
stripe, that for 8/4 mm diameter Cable has a single stripe, 
and that for 3 mm diameter Cable has two stripes.

• Strip 10 mm of the Cable sheath and 4 mm of each core.
• Before soldering cores and solder cup pins together, solder-
coat each of them.
• The following conditions are recommended for soldering 
each solder cup pin.
Soldering temperature: 350±5°C
Soldering period: 3±1 s
• The length marked *A should be 6.5 mm max., otherwise 
the proper degree of protection of the connector will not be 
maintained.

• Strip 14 mm of the Cable sheath and 4 mm of each core.
• Make sure that each core is not damaged and its end 
strands are not spread out.
• Mount the XY2F-0003 Locator to XY2F-0002 Crimp Tool, 
both of which are sold separately, and set the selector dial 
of the Crimp Tool to 8. 
• After mounting the crimping pins to the Locator, fully insert 
the cores to the crimping pins.
• Squeeze the handle of the Crimp Tool to press-fit the cores 
to the crimping pins.
(Squeeze the handle firmly until the handle automatically 
returns to the release position.)

that the lead colors correspond to the pin clamp numbers 
that are identical to the connector pin numbers.

• Loosen the screws on pins 1 to 4 and insert the cores 
according to the pin numbers.

• Insert the core from the side of the hold with the tab and 
tighten the screw securely (tightening torque: Pins 1 to 4: 
0.15 to 0.2 N·m, Pin 5: 0.03 to 0.05 N·m), and then cut off 
the excess wire with wire cutters.

• Bend the cable as shown below, attached the enclosed

• Mount the cover to the pin block so that the triangle mark on 
the pin block will coincide with the triangle mark on the 
cover.
• If the cover is used for a Right-angle model, the relationship 
between the position of the polarity key on the engaged side 
and cable connection direction will be determined by the 
direction in which the positioning key is inserted into the 
cover, which can be rotated by 90°.
• Fully insert the positioning key until the positioning key is 
hidden by the casing.

(5) Mounting Cap
• After mounting the cover to the pin block and the cover 
snaps into place, tighten the cap securely by hand (0.39 to 
0.49 N·m)
Recommended Cables
When connecting a commercially available cable to a 
connector assembly, use a cable with an outside diameter of 
3 to 6 mm and core conductor sizes of 0.18 to 0.75 mm2 for 
crimping connectors and 0.5 mm2 maximum for soldering 
connectors.
Note: If the cap is not tighten securely enough, the degree of protection (IP67) 
may not be maintained or vibration may cause the cap to become loose. 
Do not tighten the cap with pliers or similar tools; they may damage the 
cap.
Cap
A
Connector Arrangement
For safety, when constructing a connection system between a 
Sensor and panel with a connector, make sure that the 
connector plug is on the Sensor side and the connector socket 
is on the panel side (i.e., the female pins are located on the 
power-supply side).
Sensor Side
Connecting Cable
Panel Side
(Power-supply Side)
• After fully tightening the cap, length A should be 
approximately one of the following according to the cable

a guide.)

You can use the Waterproof 
Cover when the connector is not 
connected to ensure an IP67 
degree of protection. When 
mounting the Water-resistive 
Cover to a Connector, be sure to 
apply a torque range between 
0.39 and 0.49 N·m to tighten the 
Water-resistive Cover.

XY2F-0003 Locator
Mount with the screw, and insert the contacts from the opposite side.
Use the Crimp Tool to crimp a cable core to the XS2U 
Crimping Pin used with the XS2C or XS2G Crimping 
Connector. Both the Crimp Tool and the optional Locator are 
required for use.
• The XY2F-0002 Crimp Tool is DMC’s AFM8 (M22520/
2-01).
• The XY2F-0003 Locator is a component for positioning 
crimp terminals. Use the screw provided to mount the 
Locator to the locator guide of the Crimp Tool.
Pin-block Extraction Tool
XY2F-0001
Use this tool to extract a Pin Block from the covers in order to 
make wiring changes or corrections after the cover has been 
mounted to the pin block for Connector Assemblies (XS2C/
XS2G, soldering/crimping).

Safety Precautions
Precautions for Correct Use
Extraction Procedure
(1) Disconnecting Components
• Disconnect all components on the cap side from the cover.
• The pin block must not be extracted from the same 
Connector more than 3 times, otherwise the proper degree 
of protection of the pin block or Connector will not be 
maintained.
• Do not use the product in atmospheres or environments that 
exceed product ratings.

Cable clamp Cap
(2) Extracting Pin Block
• Insert the claws of the Tool into the four holes of the cover.
Tightening Cap (Connector Assemblies)
1) Do not use pliers to tighten caps, otherwise the caps may 
be damaged. Use your fingers to tighten the Connectors 
sufficiently.
(0.39 to 0.49 N·m)
2) If caps are not tightened securely, the Connectors may not 
maintain their proper degree of protection (i.e., IP67) or the 
caps may become loose due to vibration.

Claws
• Make sure that the pin block is outside the Tool.
Tool
Connector Connection and Disconnection
• When connecting or disconnecting Connectors, be sure to 
hold the Connectors by hand.
• Do not hold the cable when disconnecting Connectors.
• Connectors mating with sockets must be fully inserted into 
the mating sections. Tighten the thread bracket carefully so 
that the threads will not be damaged.
• Fully tighten thread bracket within a torque range between 
0.39 and 0.49 N·m and be sure that the threads of the 
opposite parts are hidden by the thread bracket.
• When disconnecting Connectors, be sure to loosen the 
thread brackets first. Do not loosen the caps.
• Thread brackets must be loosened in the cutout direction.

Degree of Protection
• Do not impose external force continuously on the joints of 
pin blocks and covers, otherwise the Connectors may not 
keep its proper degree of protection (i.e., IP67).
• The degree of protection of connectors (IP67) is not for a 
fully watertight structure. Do not use them underwater.
• Connectors are of resin mold construction. Do not impose 
excessive force on them.
Setup
• Do not make any cable bends near the base of the Unit.
• Any bends made must have a minimum radius of 40 mm.
